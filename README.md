# SmellyBlox Addon

Welcome to **SmellyBlox**! This Bedrock Edition addon adds a unique "smelling" mechanic to your Minecraft world. Use custom staves to track down specific blocks through a visual "smell" stream of particles.

## 👃 How it Works

The Smelly Staff allows you to "sniff out" target blocks. When you hold a staff, it emits a stream of stench particles that flows directly towards the nearest target block of your choice.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. The Smelly Staff
To start smelling, you first need a Smelly Staff. The addon includes various colored staves that correlate with the "stench" they emit.

From the main menu, you can:
- **Set Scan Range:** Adjust how many blocks the "stench" can detect (1-16 blocks).
- **Change Target:** Choose which block you are currently looking for.
- **Toggle State:** Activate or Deactivate the scanner.
- **Staff Position:** Move the staff to your offhand if needed.

### 3. Selecting a Target
The selection process is intuitive and visual. First, select a category of blocks:

Then, pick the specific block you want to find:

## 💨 Stinking Up the Block

Once a target is selected and the scanner is **Active**, a stream of semi-transparent stench particles will flow from your staff towards the target.

- **Slow & Smooth:** Particles move at a natural pace, creating a "stench trail" effect.
- **Foggy Appearance:** The particles appear as soft fog balls rather than sharp circles.
- **Distance-Aware:** The staff only detects blocks within your set range.
